PCSC bindings for NodeJS

## Build

Dependencies to run this out are:

* nodejs
* Linux:
  * libpcsclite
  * libpcsclite-dev
* Mac OS X:
  * XCode
* Windows:
  * Visual Studio 2010 (Express)

If you are running a Debian/Ubuntu Linux distribution you may install it this way:

    sudo apt-get install nodejs npm libpcsclite1 libpcsclite-dev

Under Mac OS X if you have updated to Maveric after installing Xcode you need to run:

    xcode-select --install

Under Windows you need to install all updates for the Windows SDK and Visual Studio
This is really annoying 100 times restart ...


Anyway afterwards to compile the native sources you may call `node-gyp`:

	node-gyp configure
	node-gyp build

Or install it via the `npm` tool:

	npm install

## Updating SmartCard/RFID tags card list

The author of PCSC, Ludovic Rousseau, is maintaining a list of known SmartCard/RFID tags on his website. This package integrate a version of it (`./lib/pcsc-list.js`), and provide a tool to update it if needed:

	npm run update-list

Or (strictly equivalent)

	./tools/updateList.js


## API

The JS-side API is still not stable, please refer to examples provided for now. 

## Testing

A test suite will be proabably written later on.

## Code sample

A little example using this library is available, you can try it this way:

	./example.js
